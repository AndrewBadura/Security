This repo is for locking down linux servers, be it centos 5 & 6, redhat, debian, or ubuntu.
It's a personal work project of mines, and any type of comments or additions would be appreciated.

Thanks for using or reading or helping out!

...also, I am an idiot sometimes and don't know what I'm doing.
